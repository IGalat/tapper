## About

- What is the software application or feature?

Automation tool for macros, remapping keys, and hotkeys, in python

- Whoâ€™s it intended for?

Developers, gamers, casuls

- What problem does the software solve?

Conditionally triggering actions/scripts in python; key remapping per-app

- How is it going to work?

By having user configure triggers and corresponding actions, and running a loop waiting for triggers

- What are the main concepts that are involved and how are they related?

"hotkeys" provide the ability to trigger "automation", or remapping

## Development milestones

1. DONE. Parent classes for SignalListener and Commander
2. DONE. keyboard and mouse dataclasses
3. DONE. Parent SignalListener+Commander for kb and mouse; factories; Windows impl
4. DONE. Action runner
5. DONE. Send Command parser
6. DONE. Trigger parser
7. DONE. State(logger/keeper/whatever);
8. DONE. Wrapper for commanders and listeners(state keeper calls, publish event, bounce fake signal)
9. DONE. SendCommandProcessor
10. DONE. Tree (Tap and group) model: api and shadow
11. DONE. tapper api
12. DONE. SignalProcessor
13. DONE. Initializer
14. DONE. trigger_if - free-style conditions
15. DONE. kwargs map, to make conditions for Taps much easier; TriggerConditions system
16. DONE. WindowTriggerConditionsTracker
17. DONE. Helper: controls, do while pressed/held, recorder
18. DONE. Basic Readme
19. skip - DONE(Only keyboard). Linux impl
20. skip - Make sure it catches signals before other programs on OS
21. Helper: one keyboard variation(ua) to make sure it's multi-lang
22. (input/output multi-lang) ehhh, just hepler function here
23. Tray icon
24. Tree and config validation with tkinter warnings, Error handling, Logging
25. Moar trackers: kb lang, process, device connect/disconnect, service/daemon, file, resource(cpu/gpu/network) load
26. Group actions when it goes on/off, timer for checking group states? Tap without trigger, only for on/off active
27. Helpers galore: picture assist, on repeat/hold, ?
28. Good docs, with sphinx/readthedocs/doctest
29. Optimization: profile everything, make caching, active tracking, for window controller in particular


## Limitations of the current design

Unable to terminate/pause/unpause actions.
Would probably need multiprocessing for that.

No hotstrings: made the decision to not implement them.

On win32, shift+insert is not emulatable, shift is raised before insert is pressed.

Cannot do mass things, like lock all buttons until something is pressed.


## Possible extensions to think about for the future

send command arg "key_cleanup" - to lift keys that remain pressed.

"lift" on send: lift modificators, un-caps, then back

tap additional keys allowed - white/blacklist

powerwash example action: move left-right, up, repeat - until mouse is moved

an executable with no python dependency for windows dummies

action on press 2s, not on release after 2s (see parser spec)


### Limitations of implementation / Backlog

While action is running and concurrency not allowed, other taps will still have blocked trigger keys.
